Repo for the semester project SS2022

Push into main only at the end of sprint

Use branches for your edit, so we do not change the "main" code before we are sure it works

It is quite self explanatory, but for now I divided the repository in sub-folders in order to keep the different file types separeted. Do not forget to use this same structure for your local project, in order to avoid filepaths conflicts.


Generally try to comment the code, so that anyone can understand and use it.


Variables notation:

normale Variable --> camelCase  word1 small , word2/3... big e.g. let newCard = x;

const --> first letter capital.

functions --> same as for variables

Generally, use understandable names, besides for one time variables (e.g. iterations, temporary variables etc...)
